-- WINDOW FUNCTIONS
-- A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. 
-- This is comparable to the type of calculation that can be done with an aggregate function. But unlike regular 
-- aggregate functions, use of a window function does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row — the 
-- rows retain their separate identities. Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access more than just the current row of the query result.

--- create a running total of standard_amt_usd (in the orders table) over order time with no date truncation. Your final table should have two columns: one with the amount being added for each new row, and a second with the running total.
SELECT standard_amt_usd,
       SUM(standard_amt_usd) OVER (ORDER BY occurred_at) AS running_total
FROM orders
--- Now, modify your query from the previous quiz to include partitions. Still create a running total of standard_amt_usd (in the orders table) over order time, but this time, date truncate occurred_at by year and partition by that same year-truncated occurred_at variable. Your final table should have three columns: One with the amount being added for each row, one for the truncated date, and a final column with the running total within each year.
SELECT standard_amt_usd,
       DATE_TRUNC('year', occurred_at) as year,
       SUM(standard_amt_usd) OVER (PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC('year', occurred_at) ORDER BY occurred_at) AS running_total
FROM orders

-- ROW_NUMBER & RANK
--- Select the id, account_id, and total variable from the orders table, then create a column called total_rank that ranks this total amount of paper ordered (from highest to lowest) for each account using a partition. Your final table should have these four columns.
SELECT id,
       account_id,
       total,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY total DESC) AS total_rank
FROM orders
--- The ORDER BY clause is one of two clauses integral to window functions. The ORDER and PARTITION define what is referred to as the “window”—the ordered subset of data over which calculations are made. Removing ORDER BY just leaves an unordered partition; in our query's case, each column's value is simply an aggregation (e.g., sum, count, average, minimum, or maximum) of all the standard_qty values in its respective account_id.
--- The easiest way to think about this - leaving the ORDER BY out is equivalent to "ordering" in a way that all rows in the partition are "equal" to each other. Indeed, you can get the same effect by explicitly adding the ORDER BY clause like this: ORDER BY 0 (or "order by" any constant expression), or even, more emphatically, ORDER BY NULL.

-- WINDOW clause is used between WHERE and GROUP BY clauses and is used to define alias for windows, if we plan to define multiple or reuse it.

       AVG(total_amt_usd) OVER main_window AS avg_total_amt_usd,

-- LEAD, LAG
--- LAG returns the value from a previous row to the current row in the table.
--- LEAD returns the value from a next row to the current row in the table.

-- NTILE 
--- used to identify what percentile (or quartile, or any other subdivision) a given row falls into. The syntax is NTILE(*# of buckets*). In this case, ORDER BY determines which column to use to determine the quartiles (or whatever number of ‘tiles you specify).
--- Use the NTILE functionality to divide the accounts into 4 levels in terms of the amount of standard_qty for their orders. Your resulting table should have the account_id, the occurred_at time for each order, the total amount of standard_qty paper purchased, and one of four levels in a standard_quartile column.
SELECT account_id,
occurred_at, SUM(standard_qty) AS total_purchased,
NTILE(4) OVER(ORDER BY SUM(standard_qty)) AS standard_quartile
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY standard_quartile DESC
--- Use the NTILE functionality to divide the accounts into two levels in terms of the amount of gloss_qty for their orders. Your resulting table should have the account_id, the occurred_at time for each order, the total amount of gloss_qty paper purchased, and one of two levels in a gloss_half column.
SELECT account_id,
occurred_at, SUM(gloss_qty) AS gloss_ttl,
NTILE(2) OVER(ORDER BY SUM(gloss_qty)) AS gloss_half
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY gloss_ttl DESC
--- Use the NTILE functionality to divide the orders for each account into 100 levels in terms of the amount of total_amt_usd for their orders. Your resulting table should have the account_id, the occurred_at time for each order, the total amount of total_amt_usd paper purchased, and one of 100 levels in a total_percentile column.
SELECT account_id,
occurred_at, SUM(total_amt_usd) AS total_spent,
NTILE(100) OVER(ORDER BY SUM(total_amt_usd)) AS total_percentile
